I am currently working as a Scientist in Signal and Image Processing Group at Space Applications Center (SAC), Ahmedabad. My research interest broadly spans the application of Artificial Intelligence to solve computer vision problems, including Image and Video Compression and Spatio-spectral Super-Resolution. I am also interested in studying and utilizing the theoretical aspects of Machine Learning to explain and assess the behaviour of neural networks.
